# Recommendarr

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19d332af-f90d-4b6d-8750-4be07bc45161)

Recommendarr is a web application that generates personalized TV show and movie recommendations based on your Sonarr, Radarr, Plex, and Jellyfin libraries using AI.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: When accessing this application from outside your network, you must open port 3030 on your router/firewall.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è PORT REQUIREMENT**: The application currently requires mapping exactly to ports 3030 (frontend) and 3050 (API). These port mappings cannot be changed without breaking functionality. You must map 3030:3030 and 3050:3050 in your Docker configuration.

## üåü Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Get personalized TV show and movie suggestions based on your existing library
- **Sonarr & Radarr Integration**: Connects directly to your media servers to analyze your TV and movie collections
- **Plex, Jellyfin, Tautulli & Trakt Integration**: Analyzes your watch history to provide better recommendations based on what you've actually watched
- **Flexible AI Support**: Works with OpenAI, local models (Ollama/LM Studio), or any OpenAI-compatible API
- **Customization Options**: Adjust recommendation count, model parameters, and more
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes based on your preference
- **Poster Images**: Displays media posters with fallback generation

## üìã Prerequisites

- [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) instance with API access (for TV recommendations)
- [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) instance with API access (for movie recommendations)
- [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/), [Tautulli](https://tautulli.com/), or [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/) instance with API access (for watch history analysis) - optional
- An OpenAI API key or any OpenAI-compatible API (like local LLM servers)
- Node.js (v14+) and npm for development

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

The easiest way to run Recommendarr with all features is to use Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository (which includes the docker-compose.yml file)
git clone https://github.com/fingerthief/recommendarr.git
cd recommendarr

# Start the application
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will:
1. Build the combined container with both frontend and API server
2. Configure proper networking and persistence
3. Start the unified service

Then visit `http://localhost:3030` in your browser to access the application.

**Default Login:** 
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `1234`

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Please change your password immediately after your first login for security reasons.

The unified container runs both the frontend (on port 3030) and the API server (on port 3050 internally). This provides secure credential storage and proxy functionality for accessing services that may be blocked by CORS restrictions.

**Note:** If accessing from outside your network, remember to forward port 3030 on your router/firewall.

### Option 2: Docker (Manual Run)

You can also run the unified container manually:

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest

# Run the container
# IMPORTANT: Port mappings must be exactly 3030:3030 and 3050:3050
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -p 3030:3030 \
  -p 3050:3050 \
  -v $(pwd)/server/data:/app/server/data \
  tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3030` in your browser. The container includes both the frontend and API server for secure credential storage.

For more Docker options, see the [Docker Support](#-docker-support) section below.

## üêã Docker Support

### Option 1: Pull and Run Pre-built Image

The easiest way to run Recommendarr:

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest

# Run the container (basic)
# IMPORTANT: Port mappings must be exactly 3030:3030 and 3050:3050
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -p 3030:3030 \
  -p 3050:3050 \
  -v $(pwd)/server/data:/app/server/data \
  tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest
```

### Option 2: Build and Run Locally

If you want to build the Docker image yourself:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fingerthief/recommendarr.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd recommendarr

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t recommendarr:local .

# Run the container
# IMPORTANT: Port mappings must be exactly 3030:3030 and 3050:3050
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -p 3030:3030 \
  -p 3050:3050 \
  -v $(pwd)/server/data:/app/server/data \
  recommendarr:local
```


**Key benefits of using the Docker Compose method:**
- The data directory is mounted as a volume, ensuring your credentials persist across container restarts
- The frontend and API server are bundled together in a single container
- All your service credentials are stored securely using encryption
- CORS issues are automatically handled through the proxy service
- Custom URL configuration for reverse proxy setups (via environment variables)

**Note:** You cannot change the port mappings without breaking functionality. The app must use ports 3030 and 3050 internally.

## üåê Setting Up with a Reverse Proxy

If you want to run Recommendarr behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx, Traefik, or Caddy), you **must** build the image yourself with specific build arguments. The pre-built image will not work correctly with a reverse proxy.

Your reverse proxy should be configured to (example):

1. Forward requests from `https://recommendarr.yourdomain.com` to `http://your-docker-host:3030`
2. Forward requests from `https://api.yourdomain.com` to `http://your-docker-host:3050`

For now the proper reverse proxy setup is to either:

- run a build command and pass in the args  (replace with your URLs)
  - `docker build --build-arg VUE_APP_API_URL=https://api.myapp.recommendarr.com --build-arg PUBLIC_URL=https://myapp.recommendarr.com -t recommendarr:latest .`

  
  - `docker run -p 3030:3030 -p 3050:3050 -e VUE_APP_API_URL="https://api.myapp.recommendarr.com" -e PUBLIC_URL="https://myapp.recommendarr.com" -v recommendarr-data:/app/server/data . --build`

- use the updated docker-compose and run `docker-compose up -d --build`, obviously replace the URLs with the ones correct for your setup.

```bash
services:
  recommendarr:
    #IF NOT using a reverse proxy uncomment the image tag to use prebuilt
    #image: tannermiddleton/recommendarr:latest
    # Uncomment and build locally if you need a Reverse Proxy
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        # Build time arguments - set these for the Vue.js build process
        #Reverse proxy example
        - VUE_APP_API_URL=https://api.myapp.recommendarr.com
        #Local example
        #- VUE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3050
        - BASE_URL=/
    container_name: recommendarr
    ports:
      - "3030:3030"  # Frontend port
      - "3050:3050"  # Backend API port
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DOCKER_ENV=true
      # Runtime environment variables - customize these as needed
      # For local use, the defaults should work without changes
      #- PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3030
      #- VUE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3050
      # For reverse proxy setups, uncomment and modify these do NOT forget the build section above
      - PUBLIC_URL=https://myapp.recommendarr.com
      - VUE_APP_API_URL=https://api.myapp.recommendarr.com
    volumes:
      - recommendarr-data:/app/server/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  recommendarr-data:
```

**IMPORTANT:** The internal port mappings in the Docker container must remain 3030:3030 and 3050:3050.

### Method 2: Manual Docker Build and Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fingerthief/recommendarr.git
cd recommendarr

# Build the image with your URLs
docker build -t recommendarr:custom \
  --build-arg BASE_URL=https://recommendarr.yourdomain.com \
  --build-arg VUE_APP_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com \
  .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name recommendarr \
  -p 3030:3030 \
  -p 3050:3050 \
  -v $(pwd)/server/data:/app/server/data \
  recommendarr:custom
```
